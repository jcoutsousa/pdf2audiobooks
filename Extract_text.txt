Barack Obama:  Words Matter 
 
Don’t tell me words don’t matter. I have a dream – just words words. We hold 
these truths to be self evident that all men are creat ed equal – just words. We

we can’t inspire our country to believe again, then it doesn’t matter how many

United States of America, and that’s why we just won 8 elections straight because the American people want to belie ve in change again. Don’t tell me 
words don’t matter!
